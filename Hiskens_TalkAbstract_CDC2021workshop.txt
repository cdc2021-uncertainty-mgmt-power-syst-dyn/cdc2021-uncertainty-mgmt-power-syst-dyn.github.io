Many of the models that underpin the analysis of power
system dynamic behavior are quite uncertain. In particular, loads are
continually changing and are seldom known precisely. This situation is
further exacerbated by the uncertainty inherent in renewable
generation and highly-responsive load control schemes. Furthermore, as
power system controls become more dependent upon wide-area
communications, uncertainty associated with signal latency will become
increasingly important. This talk will provide an overview of
techniques that are applicable for assessing the impact of uncertainty
on large-scale, nonlinear, non-smooth dynamical systems. These
techniques will be used to establish uncertainty bounds on the dynamic
behavior of power system.
